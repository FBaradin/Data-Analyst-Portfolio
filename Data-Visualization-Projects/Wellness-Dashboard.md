## Project 1: Wellness Dashboard

Welcome to my Power BI project, "Wellness Dashboard". This project showcases my data visualization and reporting skills using Power BI.

- **Project Description:** This interactive dashboard was designed to monitor and visualize my progress in achieving health and fitness goals by tracking food intake and exercise accomplishments. Data collected from the Huawei Health app and Seca MyAnalytics software was used to gather the necessary information.

- **Key Visualizations:** There are 3 main areas within the dashboard: food, exercise and sleep quality. Also, filters were used to track progress between each session with the nutritionist. 

- **Report and Dashboard:** Here you can take a look at the dashboard:

- **Tools Used:** In addition with Power BI, Microsoft Excel was used to gather the data collected from different apps. The spreadsheet is hosted in OneDrive so online updates can be made across multiple devices.

- **Data Model:** This dashboard uses a single table containing all the necessary data. The model is pretty simple because the focus of this project was to showcase the visual aspect of the tool.

- **Further Development:** The next step is to compare my results with other people results.
