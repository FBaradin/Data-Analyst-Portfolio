## Project: Tickets Analysis

Welcome to my Google Looker Studio project, "Tickets Analysis". This project showcases my data visualization and reporting skills using Google Looker Studio. 

- **Project Description:** This is a real world example, where we had the necessity to analyze our current scenario regarding tickets resolution and potential SLA's infringements. The department was really new and we had zero documentation or previous processes to analyze data. We just created tickets and tried to solve them. But upper management needed to have more insights about our current scenario: main clients, number of open tickets, agents solving them, team progression, etc.

- **Key Visualizations:** I decided to use 3 different visualizations to complete the analysis: Tickets by client, tickets by agent, and tickets summary by week. Also, we added scorecards with specific information and a second page tracking the SLA infringements.

- **Report and Dashboard:** Here you can take a look at the dashboard:

As this was a real world example, we had to hide our client's names and the company's specific details, as well as the specific insights we extracted from that data. That's the reason we can't add the specific dashboard here for you to interact.
However, we can share a few images to showcase what we did.

- **Tools Used:** In addition with Google Looker Studio, Google Sheets was used to gather the data collected from different apps. The spreadsheet used a Jira extension to import all the necessary information to feed the dashboard with automatic updates each hour.

- **Data Model:** This dashboard uses two different tables containing the tickets information and the client's information. The model includes a blended table with a left join to link the two tables as well as many calculated fields.

- **Valuable Insights:** The main insight from the completed analysis was that the team was creating more tickets than what they were able to solve. At this point, the operation was not sustainable with current resources, and many decisions had to be taken in order to maintain the business goals. 

- **Further Development:** After creating the dashboard, our job was to keep checking our dashboard's health, meaning the data sources being well synced and adding small features to keep improving the analysis done with this tool. Of course, we also had to document our work in order to allow future members to build on top of what we did here.
