## Project 2: Fuel consumption

Welcome to my Power BI project, "Fuel consumption". This project showcases my data visualization and reporting skills using Power BI.

- **Project Description:** This interactive dashboard was designed to monitor and visualize my personal fuel consumption by tracking money spent on fuel and travelled distances. All the data was collected manually.

- **Key Visualizations:** There are 2 main visuals within the dashboard: driven km per fuel liter, and cost of driven km. Also, there are 4 scorecards with important information of single statistics.  

- **Report and Dashboard:** Here you can take a look at the dashboard:

- **Tools Used:** In addition with Power BI, Microsoft Excel was used to gather the data collected from different apps. The spreadsheet is hosted in OneDrive so online updates can be made across multiple devices.

- **Data Model:** This dashboard uses a single table containing all the necessary data. The model is pretty simple because the focus of this project was to showcase the visual aspect of the tool.

- **Further Development:** The next step is to compare my results with other people results.
